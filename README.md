# Software-Test-Automation

The test phase in the software development life cycle helps the team find defects, bugs, and security issues prior to the deployment. It's considered one of the most important phases that ensures the quality of the product. It begins with creating a Test Plan according to the requirements and the specs given by the client. There are three types of tests: Quality Assurance (QA), System Integration Testing (SIT), and User Acceptability Testing (UAT).
Quality Assurance Testing is the test process that assures the application meets the client's requirements. On the other hand, System Integration Testing checks how well the software interacts with other applications. Finally, User Acceptability Testing is the last type of testing that will be performed by the end of the user or clients to verify and accept the software. Each type can be automated and run in continuous integration systems. 
Worth noting, testing is integrated into all phases thought out SDLC. This means having the test plan early on before the code can help prevent lots of errors and time last. Also, itâ€™s often to start User Acceptability Testing in the early stages with Quality Assurance to prevent miscommunications and engage the clients early in the development cycle.  At the end of the day, it all depends on how big the requirements are.
